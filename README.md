Zenith UI is a dark &amp; light themed design system built in Material-UI + React using Brad Frost's atomic design philosophy.

# Motivation
This repository's purpose serves as a thought experiment of Brad Frost's Atomic Design principles in React. Rather than serving as an actual UI library (though there are plans to implement a standalone repo for such a purpose), the main goal of this project is excerise a the enginerring of a scalable frontend application that adheres to the following goals:

1. Extensibility - The project should be able to be extended with minimal effort
2. Reusability (Modularity) - The project should consist of composible components in accordance with the Atomic Design philosphy.
3. Readability - The project structure should be easy to read relative to it's structure.

More importantly:
> To serve as a template for other client-side applications built in React
